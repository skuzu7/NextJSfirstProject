# Next.js Shopping Cart Project

This is a Next.js project bootstrapped with `create-next-app`.

## Description

The Next.js Shopping Cart project is a simple e-commerce web application that allows users to browse and purchase products online. The application uses Next.js, a popular React framework for building server-side-rendered (SSR) and static websites. It leverages the Stripe API for handling payment processing, and Swiper for creating a responsive product carousel.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Install the dependencies using the package manager of your choice (npm, yarn, or pnpm):
   ```bash
   npm install
   # or
   yarn install
   # or
   pnpm install

   
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev


Open http://localhost:3000 with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying pages/index.tsx. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

API Routes
API routes can be accessed on http://localhost:3000/api/hello. This endpoint can be edited in pages/api/hello.ts.

The pages/api directory is mapped to /api/*. Files in this directory are treated as API routes instead of React pages.

Font Optimization
This project uses next/font to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Project Description
The project consists of a React application with a shopping cart manager using the Context API. It allows users to add items to the cart, remove items from the cart, and view the total price of the added items. The cart manager is implemented through a CartProvider component, which provides a context for other application components to access and interact with the cart.

Additionally, the application includes an integration with the Stripe API to process payments, using a Next.js API to create checkout sessions. This makes it possible to securely and efficiently handle payments when users finalize their purchases in the cart.

The project provides a complete and functional solution for shopping cart management and payment processing in a React-based web application.
